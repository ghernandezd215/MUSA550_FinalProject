Hello Everyone,

My name is Gabriel. I was born in Cuba and came to United States when I was 7 years old. In many ways, that experience, and that of returning 'home' every 3 years, significantly shaped my self and my academic interests. I research the intersection between production of history, material realities, and people. Naturally, this led me to the field of planning and real estate development. Furthermore, my interest in the minds of individuals motivated me to pursue minors in both Religions and Psychology. 

In my final year of undergrad at Hunter College, I took an introduction to GIS course that opened my eyes to the value of spatial data and its potential to aid decision making and its power to provide insight into the relationship between people and the built environment. I also see a future in which i use my computation and spatial analysis skills to perform market and site analysis for my own projects. Overall, I hope to help communities tell their own stories and assist organizations in the development of policies and initiatives that holistically tackle the issues of their constituents.
