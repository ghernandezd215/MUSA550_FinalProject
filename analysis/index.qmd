# Analysis

This section includes the code that I used to create the final product of this project: Nehemiah HDFC's properties merged with MAPPLUTO as a shapefile that can be visualized. For the first time in its 30+ year history, Nehemiah can visualize the scale of their work in East Brooklyn neighborhoods and tell its story through a different medium. 

To see a visualization of the data, please scroll all the way to the bottom and engage with the interactive map.

Best,


Gabriel
